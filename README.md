# ISA manipal's website

This is a quick todo list I've made to keep track of this

#### TODO:
 - Change up the look by changing scss
 - Add in all the posts and images in the correct places (posts go in \_posts as a markdown file, images shouold be in /images/\<sub system name\>/\<post name\>/\<image name\>)
 - Stick to the naming scheme for posts (the file should be "yyyy-mm-dd-\<post name\>.md")(remove the example post when done)

 
 - (Maybe) Add a "tag" for posts so we can group content by the tag
